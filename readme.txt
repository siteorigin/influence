We created Influence with the single goal of building a platform for you to influence the world with your content.

== Description ==

Influence is a free WordPress theme that gives you a canvas to share your videos, photography and content. It features a modern, responsive design and tight integration with our own Page Builder plugin to make sure your content is responsive too. The best feature of Influence is its huge home page slider - perfect if you're using Influence to build a business or portfolio website. This slider has support for video background images and, like the rest of Influence, is fully responsive. We offer free support on our support forums (http://siteorigin.com/thread/).
